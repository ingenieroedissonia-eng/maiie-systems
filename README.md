# MAIIE Systems

**MAIIE Systems (Model of Intelligent Architecture & Engineering by Edisson)** is an architecture-first framework designed to build, govern, and execute AI-powered decision systems ready for real-world production.

It focuses on **governance, traceability, risk control, and measurable business impact**, not experimentation.

---

## 🚩 The Problem

Many AI systems fail in production due to:

- Lack of architectural governance  
- Poor decision traceability  
- Uncontrolled technical risk  
- Misalignment with business objectives  

Most projects focus on models, not on **decision systems**.

---

## 🎯 The Solution

MAIIE Systems introduces a **decision-centric, architecture-first approach** that ensures:

- Clear roles, phases, and responsibilities  
- Controlled execution and validation  
- Alignment between AI, operations, and ROI  
- Long-term architectural stability
